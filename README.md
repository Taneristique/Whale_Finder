# Whale Finder v1.0.0
This version only supports ethereum network and ERC20 tokens.Here is how it works let assume that we want to find the whales who transfers 100000 or more usdt 
on blockchain.In this scenario,we will start opening token page of usdt on etherscan : https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7

Than we have to copy token address which is selected with blue color.

Than we have to past it onto Token Contract Address section.

Next,we have to return etherscan change contract section which is showed in a red box at the image.Than we will past it onto Token ABI section.

After putting these informations we have to decide a value that decides if the transaction done by a whale or not.As you remember the users who send more than or equal to 100000usdt(it means also >=100000usd) were whale in our example.So we have to write 100000 on
usdt were whale for our example.So for transfer threshold section we have to write 100000000000. You may be confused why not 100000 instead 100000000000.The reason is in blockchain we write amount+decimal to show an amount for example think 1eth if you want to write it in correct format, you have to add 18 zeros after 1 so we write 1 ether as 1000000000000000000. In usdt there are 6 decimals,this is why we write 100000000000 which is 100000+6 decimals(6 digits) but how to find decimal of a token?

To be able to learn how many decimal our token has,we have to click Read Contract which shows in purple box in image than copy the informations write under decimal(shows in green color at image).
![instruction7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48108872/181062433-ce3f6b1d-e48f-40e3-9bd0-6d8b0172b47c.png)
We wrote 100000000000 to specifiy 100000usdt as explained before on transfer treshold section.Now one step left,you have to click use mobile version if you use this app on a mobile device else directly click submit.Let's first look at the mobile version:
![instruction8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48108872/181063585-5196f50d-c33e-4e70-aec4-4173228561c9.png)

And here is the computer version:

For being able to view transactions please click on F12 on your computer than select console section.And here we go, now we view the whale transactionsðŸ™‚

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
